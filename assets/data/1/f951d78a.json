Portraying the sublime beauty of the world as well as mundane objects, like a simple washing machine, in a poetic manner that strikes right trough the heart. The song of a blackbird occurs as the leitmotif of the album, smartly depicted as a waveform on the cover. Tons of emotions bursting out of Bush&#8217;s dramatic soprano in this 2005 record released after a twelve-year hiatus. An all time favorite that I keep coming back to.</p>\n","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Aerial.jpg","altText":"Aerial","mediaDetails":{"width":1000}},"categories":[{"id":"33","title":"Album of the week","path":"/category/album-of-the-week"}],"tags":[{"id":"30","title":"album-of-the-week","path":"/tag/album-of-the-week","count":18}]}},"context":{}}
