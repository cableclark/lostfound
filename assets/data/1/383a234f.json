The cinematographic terror that horror offers comes in many sub-genre forms that are quite successful in stimulating the hidden fears and phobias of the audience. In his recent horror flick <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6998518/\" target=\"_blank\">Mandy</a> (2018), the Canadian director of Greek origin, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panos_Cosmatos\" target=\"_blank\">Panos Cosmatos</a>, managed to create a visually impressive and thematically rich work of art that is able to penetrate the boundaries set by genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandy is a two part film, the first one being slow, calm, psychedelic and esoteric, while the other part is fast, ruthless, bloody and filled with action, and in some instances rather comical. In terms of its visual aesthetics, Mandy emanates with an incredible color range. The colors give an impression the audience is faced with a surreal environment, a dream, a fantasy parade or a psychedelic trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part of the film depicts Mandy&nbsp;(Andrea Riseborough) and Red&nbsp;(Nicolas Cage), a modest pair living modest lives doing modest jobs. Red is a lumberjack, while Mandy works at small convenience store. They spend their time in conversation about ordinary and unusual things, about their favorite planets and their growing pains. The love, harmony and understating between them reveals that their modest way of life is sufficient for happiness. Their house is in the middle of the woods and has huge glass windows that distort the light and create an ambiance of a perfectly isolated bubble.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-opt-src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg\"  width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20576%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22576%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-101\"/><noscript><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-101\"/></noscript><figcaption>Photo credit: IMDb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Mandy is not an ordinary girl. Her long black hair, big eyes and black clothes reveal the witch. She paints terrific paintings, reads occult literature and is an astrology enthusiast. Mandy is magical and mysterious, walks with the shoulders straight, talks calmly and self-confidently.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-opt-src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:682/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BY2Y2ZWU1ZmYtNzg4OC00ZDdmLWEyYTItMzU2ZGFiYTZlOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg\"  width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20682%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22682%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-102\"/><noscript><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:682/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BY2Y2ZWU1ZmYtNzg4OC00ZDdmLWEyYTItMzU2ZGFiYTZlOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-102\"/></noscript><figcaption>Photo credit: IMDb</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, there is Jeremiah (Linus Roache),&nbsp;a total opposite of Mandy. He is a failed folk singer/songwriter and a leader of a small cult. This narcissist is surrounded by his docile followers, a small band of petty losers. Jeremiah persuades himself and the others that he is not an ordinary man, that god granted him special powers and the right to do and posses whatever he wants. He demonstrates supremacy and divinity, but the low self opinion eats him from the inside. His character is a reminiscent of a manipulative leader of a religious or satanist cult, a hippy movement, a party leader, a group of hooligans or a criminal organization. And, as in the case of many of such individuals, Jeremiah’s hands are not drenched in blood, but the ruthless acts of evil are committed by his followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-opt-src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg\"  width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20576%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22576%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-103\"/><noscript><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-103\"/></noscript><figcaption>Photo credit: IMDb</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While walking in the woods all by herself, Mandy meets Jeremiah and, even though the encounter lasts only for a moment, he becomes obsessed with her and the idea that he must posses her. Using the help of a group of monstrous creatures, his cult manages to imprison and later torture Mandy and Red. In a hell infused by psychedelics, Jeremiah is unable to mindfuck Mandy in submission. Verbally, she is able to hit him right in the soft spot &#8211; his shaky ego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The turn of the events goes further down the spiral and this is the moment when the first part of the film ends. The scene in which Red, recently traumatized by the demonic cult, sits on the toilet sit and starts drinking alcohol uncontrollably, leads us into the second part of the movie that represents a revenge saga, a festival of brutality and a proper meat grinder. The scene is both sad and funny at the same time. It is easy to notice the juxtaposition between, on one hand Red’s funny looks &#8211; a bloody head  and dressed only in his undies and silly t-shirt, and on the other &#8211; the volcano of emotions that erupt out of him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a great extent, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/PKZEBhRX-TU\" target=\"_blank\">atmospheric music</a> of the Icelandic author Jóhann Jóhannsson  complements to the film’s surreal ambience. Partially programmed and partially live, Jóhannsson&#8217;s music contributes to the completion of the dark, violent and full-on insane atmosphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandy represents an aesthetic perfection and much more than a plain one-dimensional horror film. Perhaps it was Comatos’ intention to target the  true fans of horror cinema, but I saw the movie from a different angle. Despite the terror and bloodbath, for me, Mandy is a story that praises love. I guess I&#8217;m a hopeless romantic.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;You made this song?
