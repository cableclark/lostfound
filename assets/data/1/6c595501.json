Their third studio album named &#8220;Today&#8221; brings positive vibes all over. A groovy bassline,Â a bit late 60s psychodelia, some bossa nova tunes and a pinch of Afrobeats. One cannot simply resist to chill with their music.</p>\n","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Babe-Rainbow.jpg","altText":"The Babe Rainbow - Today","mediaDetails":{"width":1200}},"categories":[{"id":"33","title":"Album of the week","path":"/category/album-of-the-week"}],"tags":[{"id":"30","title":"album-of-the-week","path":"/tag/album-of-the-week","count":18}]}},"context":{}}
