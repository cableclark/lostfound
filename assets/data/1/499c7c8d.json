This riddled rule has never resounded more than on Jassbusters, Mockasin’s third album and first in five years. An unclassifiable, unconventional album that neither picks up from nor abandons the modes of 2013’s widely-embraced Caramel or its 2010 predecessor Forever Dolphin Love, Jassbusters foreshadows a five-part melodrama titled Bostyn ’n Dobsyn, directed by and staring Mockasin. Jassbusters soundtracks the unpredictable narrative of the television series in eclectic, electric ways.</p>\n","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Jassbusters.jpg","altText":"Jassbusters Connan Mockasin","mediaDetails":{"width":700}},"categories":[{"id":"33","title":"Album of the week","path":"/category/album-of-the-week"}],"tags":[{"id":"30","title":"album-of-the-week","path":"/tag/album-of-the-week","count":18}]}},"context":{}}
