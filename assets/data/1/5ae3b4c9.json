A few years back it was only a shy notion, but now it could definitely be said that Australia along with New Zealand have the most interesting and most productive alternative scenes, especially in terms of psychedelic rock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Australia has always had a vibrant rock and roll scene. As we researched their underground scene, we realized that this continent has given us a plethora of cult bands on a global level. Still, the Australian cultural influence was not as able to penetrate the boundaries when compared to the ginormous American or British influence. Thus, in our heads, Australia remained a partial <em>terra incongnita.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we list some of our favorite bands and artists originating from Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"512\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sidney-Olivia-Dorazi.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise_in_Sidney\" class=\"wp-image-72\" srcset=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:512/h:640/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sidney-Olivia-Dorazi.jpg 512w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:240/h:300/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sidney-Olivia-Dorazi.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /><figcaption>Photo: Sunrise in Sidney, by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oliviadoraziart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Olivia Dorazi</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard&nbsp;represent one of the most productive bands of the Australian scene that emerged at the start of the 2010s.&nbsp;Since they held their promise to release five albums in 2017 (with Gumboot soup they managed to fulfill that promise just in time on the 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of December, 2017), the band has toured Europe and America and almost all of their dates were sold out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard - The Fourth Colour - (Live)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9G5uLFxIj8w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Babe Rainbow</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The hippies are alive and live in Australia. It is unimaginable how The Babe Rainbow manage to sound and look as if they were literally brought to the present by a time machine. With the marry colors, sounds and positive vibrations there carry the groove and charm of the late 1960s. Their positive music shines with sunny light from the warm meadows of the south hemisphere. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Babe Rainbow - Peace Blossom Boogy (Official Video)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p875E_kk50o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Courtney Barnett</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This modest Australian managed to get the world’s attention and to build a sold fan base, especially in the United States. After her collaboration with Kurt Vile, an interesting combination of two artists that resulted in their record Lotta Sea Lice, Courtney Barnett&nbsp;announced her second album Tell Me How You Really Feel&nbsp;scheduled for release in May. Three singles from the album have already been released.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Courtney Barnett - Need A Little Time\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TISIPNpRuoY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Fazerdaze</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, those wonderful 90s! The era of flannel plaid shirts, Dr. Martens, Levis and alternative music as mainstream culture. The current generations often cite the music and fashion deriving from this era. Fazedaze is a nice girl from New Zealand whose dreampop/shoegase music is incredibly reminiscent of the 90’s and turns on the nostalgia switch right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Little Uneasy - Fazerdaze\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/szvFmW_oxeY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pond</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Band that is inescapably related to Tame Impala. The members of both bands frequently interchange, while the former is fronted by Nick Allbrook. On their former records the music resembles psychedelic rock, but on their latest record (it could be argued in a disappointing manner) they experiment with synth pop in a similar manner as Tame Impala did on Currents. The video for the track Fire in the Water was directed by New Zealand director Sam Kristofski, who also made videos for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/My4j3vgFxbE\" target=\"_blank\">Fazerdaze</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OumAw7yfk7U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Babe Rainbow</a>. The videos feature a specific vintage ascetic and a weird obsession with hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Pond - Fire In The Water (Official Video)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BycrWr9z_X0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Chats</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Very funny and truly <em>sipmpatico </em>young surf-punks<em>. </em>Even the legendary Australian mullets found on the singer’s hairdo are completely legitimate. The simplistic punk refrain of Smoko immediately catches your ear and no wonder the song is a viral hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"THE CHATS - SMOKO  (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j58V2vC9EPc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cosmic Psychos</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Old punks formed in 1977 still bringing fresh and exiting music and worthy of mention on this list. Cosmic Psychos&nbsp;are not only relevant in Australia, but also very influential for the Seattle scene of the 1990s. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands for the stylistic formation of grunge. Eddie Vedder himself recognized Cosmic Psychos&nbsp;as an early influence on him and his band.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Cosmic Psychos - Fuckwit City\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q954LxEzyY8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More bands are worth the mention. For instance, The Murlocs, a band led by Kenny-Smith of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, the psychedelic ORB, as well as Stonefield&nbsp;&#8211; four Johnny Mitchel lookalikes sisters who originate from a town called Macedon Ranges.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>There is a new wave of freshness coming from the land down under.
