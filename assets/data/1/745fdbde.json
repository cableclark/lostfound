Antiquariat</a>, an old Viennese institution featured in the film Before sunrise. What I was not aware of, was that the city indeed has a decent number of jams that I would gladly revisit when hopefully coming to town once again. In this article, I present some of the most exciting Viennese record shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick tip:&nbsp;getting on the tram number 49 on Karl Renner station on the Ring will take you to Westbahnstrasse. Here you’ll find three record shops and you&#8217;ll be able to easily reach a number of others nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Substance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Westbahnstrasse 16</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had the time to visit only one record store in Vienna, <a href=\"https://substance-store.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Substance</a> would be it. The store has a diverse catalog along with a well-maintained website. There you’ll&nbsp;find more recent releases of mostly independent labels.
