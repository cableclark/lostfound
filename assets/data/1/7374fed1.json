In terms of music, 2010-2019 was one of the best decades.&nbsp;In terms of private life,&nbsp;it was one of the most beautiful and the hardest periods in which I experienced the greatest love and got through the greatest&nbsp;of&nbsp;pains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decade began in a slightly sad and melancholic tone. I listened to Massive Attack’s Heligoland during the winter&nbsp;2010 while receiving an antibiotic therapy &#8211; and this was the overall feel of that year: cold, sad and lonely. The next two years were alright, but nothing seemed to be as it should. As I remember, there was that winter feel&nbsp;all over. I guess listening to Kate Bush’s 50 Words For Snow helped maintain&nbsp;that feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"50 Words For Snow (2018 Remaster)\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FWU-rXv93NM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Kate Bush &#8211; 50 words for snow</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Black Keys where a leftover from a previous life, while Tame Impala lead me into modern psychedelic rock.

We talked about&nbsp;The Soft Moon’s&nbsp;performance&nbsp;at the festival&nbsp;and&nbsp;stayed together for the whole night (and we’ve been together ever since). In 2015, he played me Birds of passage and her nocturnal music took&nbsp;the form of the pain that I carried inside me. In 2016, we saw Föllakzoid and Moon Duo playing at&nbsp;the same festival.&nbsp;The following&nbsp;year,&nbsp;there was Slowdive. In the recent years, the festival’s programme began to cater the tastes in music embraced by younger generations, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;lost&nbsp;interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Ashes to Ashes\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=OLAK5uy_lGKVbaFKZsIiBBTa9DvKHThfj0M9KhL1M\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Birds of Passage &#8211; Ashes to ashes</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2017 was definitely the year of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and the sweet discovery of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://missalbini.mk/oceania-breeze/\" target=\"_blank\">Australia’s&nbsp;music scene</a>. 2018 was the year of psychedelic (guitar) music coming from all corners of the world:&nbsp;Wooden Shjips, The Babe Rainbow, Kikagaku Mojo, Minami Deutsch.

Throughout December I was thinking back to the year that passed by, but I got the festive blues and couldn’t find the strength to summarize it. On Christmas Eve I gathered my thoughts and, just like in the Christmas Carol, I let the Ghosts of the Past, the Present and the Yet To Come to remind me on what was before, how is it now and what the future might be.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Past</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"http://172.104.151.121/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kate-Bush-1024x512.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Bush\" class=\"wp-image-24\"/><figcaption>Kate Bush &#8211; Hounds of Love &amp; The Sensual World</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent large portion of 2018 with the music of Kate Bush. I cannot even explain myself what kind of a force is it that drags me towards her, but her music simply enchants me. Hearing her saying <em>„Take my shoes off/ and throw them in the lake“, </em>I literally feel the urge to throw my shoes and simply start walking wherever my feet may take me. I mostly listened to The Sensual World, Hounds of Love and Aerial.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Kate Bush - Hounds of Love - Official Music Video\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VerK4zwMRQw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Kate Bush &#8211; Hounds of love</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Smashing Pumpkins were a big deal for me back in the ‘90s, spending hours and hours listening to Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Siamese Dream and Pisces Iscariot. Yet, their debut album Gish remained quite unfamiliar, so this year I went back to correct that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"I Am One (Remastered 2011)\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HZNF4ajjQGk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Smashing Pumpkins &#8211; I am one</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gish has the unfortunate destiny to be constantly compared, and thus overshadowed, by Nirvana’s Nevermind, both produced by Butch Vig (Garbage) and released the same year of 1991. Unlike Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins&nbsp;did not gain much of a fame and fortune at&nbsp;that time, but merely appeared on the scene and announced their presence. However, the following years they took over the alternative rock music scene and marked the music of the ‘90s. This year The Smashing Pumpkins made a come-back with a new album and a tour named “Shiny And Oh So Bright” which I gladly awaited. But, I regret to state that these Smashing Pumpkins are some faded away version of that once cool band from the ‘90s. They had it, they lost it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year marks 20 years from the releasing of Air’s debut album Moon Safari. All these years I’ve never stopped listening to this album and I’ve never ever got bored of it.&nbsp;Being unpretentious and modest, it is a unique masterpiece combining electronic music, jazz, synth-pop, space-rock and trip-hop with a French twist.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"La femme d&#039;argent\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BswuwCn1hBo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Air &#8211; La femme d&#8217;argent</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading the memoir “Drugs are nice” by Lisa Crystal Carver (Lisa Suckdog), a former partner of Bill Callahan, led me to re-listen his 2011 album Apocalypse. I love it how the sound on this album is so crisp and clear that I have the feeling I can almost touch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"One Fine Morning\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NphJbinncQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Bill Callahan &#8211; One fine morning</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the memoir one could get the picture for the most obscure underground scene of the ‘80s and early ‘90s, various experimental and noise rock musicians, performance artists and complete lunatics like GG Allin, which were Lisa’s friends. I couldn’t understand how could the eccentric Lisa and the quiet Bill ever get along. She wanted to become famous, and Bill didn’t have much of ambitions. From today&#8217;s perspective, they both achieved the totally opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-opt-src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:762/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Apocalypse2-1.jpg\"  width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201024%20762%22%20width%3D%221024%22%20height%3D%22762%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246\"/><noscript><img width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:762/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Apocalypse2-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-246\"/></noscript><figcaption>Bill Callahan &#8211; Apocalypse &amp; Lisa Crystal Carver &#8211; Drugs are nice</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Present</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During January we had the time to listen to King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard’s Gumboot Soup which came out at the very end of 2017. The <a href=\"https://missalbini.mk/oceania-breeze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">alternative Australian scene</a> was a sweet discovery, but the music coming from Japan was even more exotic. The psychedelic and kraut rock music of Japanese bands Kikagaku Moyo and Minami Deutch and their 2018 albums Masana Temples and With Dim Light respectively were one of the most listened throughout 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Minami Deutsch - With Dim Light (FULL ALBUM)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytIJPsSoTQ8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Minami Deutsch &#8211; With dim light</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer was <a href=\"https://missalbini.mk/psychedelic-summer-triptych/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marked by psychedelic rock</a> listening to Wooden Shjips, Double Rainbow and Triptides.

The music on the album has this specific Balkan melody while the band was using instruments from all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Dead Can Dance - ACT II: The Invocation\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wjm5o0ZxLyg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Dead Can Dance &#8211; ACT II: The Invocation</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is something primordial in the music of Dead Can Dance which I recognize as something that belongs to me, like some long forgotten part of myself. I immediately fell in love with this album.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1020\" height=\"544\" src=\"http://172.104.151.121/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dionysis-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"Dead_Can_Dance_Dionysus\" class=\"wp-image-31\"/><figcaption>Dead Can Dance &#8211; Dionysus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yet To Come</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrongfully ignored the Ghost of the Yet To Come and didn’t assume that he could bring me another loss of a loved one at the very beginning of the year. For better or worse, once faced with a great loss in life, one learns how to deal with future pains of such scale. It doesn’t get easier, but you nevertheless learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to believe in the philosophy of the Tralfamadorians from Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five who perceive time as a whole and the destiny of every human as an eternal present.
