I listened to Massive Attack’s Heligoland during the winter&nbsp;2010 while receiving an antibiotic therapy &#8211; and this was the overall feel of that year: cold, sad and lonely. The next two years were alright, but nothing seemed to be as it should. As I remember, there was that winter feel&nbsp;all over.

In 2015, he played me Birds of passage and her nocturnal music took&nbsp;the form of the pain that I carried inside me. In 2016, we saw Föllakzoid and Moon Duo playing at&nbsp;the same festival.&nbsp;The following&nbsp;year,&nbsp;there was Slowdive.

I cannot even explain myself what kind of a force is it that drags me towards her, but her music simply enchants me. Hearing her saying <em>„Take my shoes off/ and throw them in the lake“, </em>I literally feel the urge to throw my shoes and simply start walking wherever my feet may take me. I mostly listened to The Sensual World, Hounds of Love and Aerial.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Kate Bush - Hounds of Love - Official Music Video\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VerK4zwMRQw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Kate Bush &#8211; Hounds of love</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Smashing Pumpkins were a big deal for me back in the ‘90s, spending hours and hours listening to Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, Siamese Dream and Pisces Iscariot.

Unlike Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins&nbsp;did not gain much of a fame and fortune at&nbsp;that time, but merely appeared on the scene and announced their presence. However, the following years they took over the alternative rock music scene and marked the music of the ‘90s. This year The Smashing Pumpkins made a come-back with a new album and a tour named “Shiny And Oh So Bright” which I gladly awaited. But, I regret to state that these Smashing Pumpkins are some faded away version of that once cool band from the ‘90s. They had it, they lost it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year marks 20 years from the releasing of Air’s debut album Moon Safari. All these years I’ve never stopped listening to this album and I’ve never ever got bored of it.&nbsp;Being unpretentious and modest, it is a unique masterpiece combining electronic music, jazz, synth-pop, space-rock and trip-hop with a French twist.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"La femme d&#039;argent\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BswuwCn1hBo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Air &#8211; La femme d&#8217;argent</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading the memoir “Drugs are nice” by Lisa Crystal Carver (Lisa Suckdog), a former partner of Bill Callahan, led me to re-listen his 2011 album Apocalypse.

The <a href=\"https://missalbini.mk/oceania-breeze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">alternative Australian scene</a> was a sweet discovery, but the music coming from Japan was even more exotic. The psychedelic and kraut rock music of Japanese bands Kikagaku Moyo and Minami Deutch and their 2018 albums Masana Temples and With Dim Light respectively were one of the most listened throughout 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Minami Deutsch - With Dim Light (FULL ALBUM)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytIJPsSoTQ8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Minami Deutsch &#8211; With dim light</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer was <a href=\"https://missalbini.mk/psychedelic-summer-triptych/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marked by psychedelic rock</a> listening to Wooden Shjips, Double Rainbow and Triptides.

The cinematographic terror that horror offers comes in many sub-genre forms that are quite successful in stimulating the hidden fears and phobias of the audience. In his recent horror flick <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6998518/\" target=\"_blank\">Mandy</a> (2018), the Canadian director of Greek origin, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panos_Cosmatos\" target=\"_blank\">Panos Cosmatos</a>, managed to create a visually impressive and thematically rich work of art that is able to penetrate the boundaries set by genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandy is a two part film, the first one being slow, calm, psychedelic and esoteric, while the other part is fast, ruthless, bloody and filled with action, and in some instances rather comical. In terms of its visual aesthetics, Mandy emanates with an incredible color range. The colors give an impression the audience is faced with a surreal environment, a dream, a fantasy parade or a psychedelic trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first part of the film depicts Mandy&nbsp;(Andrea Riseborough) and Red&nbsp;(Nicolas Cage), a modest pair living modest lives doing modest jobs. Red is a lumberjack, while Mandy works at small convenience store. They spend their time in conversation about ordinary and unusual things, about their favorite planets and their growing pains. The love, harmony and understating between them reveals that their modest way of life is sufficient for happiness. Their house is in the middle of the woods and has huge glass windows that distort the light and create an ambiance of a perfectly isolated bubble.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-101\" srcset=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg 1024w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:300/h:169/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg 300w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:768/h:432/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg 768w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1536/h:864/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg 1536w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1600/h:900/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZTg1ZjUyZTYtOTE2OC00MjgxLTkyOTctNDZjMTFmNzI0NDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgzMjU4NjM@._V1_.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><figcaption>Photo credit: IMDb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Mandy is not an ordinary girl.

He is a failed folk singer/songwriter and a leader of a small cult. This narcissist is surrounded by his docile followers, a small band of petty losers. Jeremiah persuades himself and the others that he is not an ordinary man, that god granted him special powers and the right to do and posses whatever he wants. He demonstrates supremacy and divinity, but the low self opinion eats him from the inside. His character is a reminiscent of a manipulative leader of a religious or satanist cult, a hippy movement, a party leader, a group of hooligans or a criminal organization. And, as in the case of many of such individuals, Jeremiah’s hands are not drenched in blood, but the ruthless acts of evil are committed by his followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-103\" srcset=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:576/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg 1024w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:300/h:169/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg 300w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:768/h:432/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg 768w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1536/h:864/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg 1536w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1600/h:900/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/MV5BZmZhYzJhYzQtMGZkOC00OGE4LTg5YmEtMGY4ZDc0NmM3ODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjc1MjIwMDM@._V1_.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><figcaption>Photo credit: IMDb</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While walking in the woods all by herself, Mandy meets Jeremiah and, even though the encounter lasts only for a moment, he becomes obsessed with her and the idea that he must posses her. Using the help of a group of monstrous creatures, his cult manages to imprison and later torture Mandy and Red. In a hell infused by psychedelics, Jeremiah is unable to mindfuck Mandy in submission. Verbally, she is able to hit him right in the soft spot &#8211; his shaky ego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The turn of the events goes further down the spiral and this is the moment when the first part of the film ends. The scene in which Red, recently traumatized by the demonic cult, sits on the toilet sit and starts drinking alcohol uncontrollably, leads us into the second part of the movie that represents a revenge saga, a festival of brutality and a proper meat grinder. The scene is both sad and funny at the same time. It is easy to notice the juxtaposition between, on one hand Red’s funny looks &#8211; a bloody head  and dressed only in his undies and silly t-shirt, and on the other &#8211; the volcano of emotions that erupt out of him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a great extent, the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/PKZEBhRX-TU\" target=\"_blank\">atmospheric music</a> of the Icelandic author Jóhann Jóhannsson  complements to the film’s surreal ambience. Partially programmed and partially live, Jóhannsson&#8217;s music contributes to the completion of the dark, violent and full-on insane atmosphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mandy represents an aesthetic perfection and much more than a plain one-dimensional horror film. Perhaps it was Comatos’ intention to target the  true fans of horror cinema, but I saw the movie from a different angle. Despite the terror and bloodbath, for me, Mandy is a story that praises love. I guess I&#8217;m a hopeless romantic.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;You made this song?

Cloudy days and temperatures below 40 degrees Celsius. I like this kind of weather since I am not a huge fan of the continental summers and extremely high temperatures (but then again, who is?). The summer heat makes me numb. It blurs my mind and it takes away the ability to think rationally.

The summer melancholy, the pink sunsets, the sudden night breeze that carries freshness. Watermelon. The beach. White legs on the send&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:581/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20180804_135307_517.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-67\" srcset=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1024/h:581/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20180804_135307_517.jpg 1024w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:300/h:170/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20180804_135307_517.jpg 300w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:768/h:436/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20180804_135307_517.jpg 768w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:1080/h:613/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20180804_135307_517.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each summer has its own soundtrack and I could say that I already have the sound of the summer of 2018. The last few months, three albums have been played the most frequently on our sound system: Wooden Shjips – V, The Babe Rainbow – Double Rainbow and Triptides – Visitors. All were released very recently, and besides having the same hook of psychedelia, they all embrace the sound of the summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Wooden Shjips &#8211; V&nbsp;</strong>(May 2018)</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Wooden Shjips ‎– V.(Full Album)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1HYT8sEDl0U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there something else to expect from a record whose front cover depicts two fingers up in the air calling for peace? V is the fifth album of the San Francisco psychedelic rockers who, even though becoming increasingly mellower with each new record, they still manage to hold their own distinctive sound. Cheerful melodies that shine with positive energy and optimism. <s>Next September we will have the opportunity to see them live on Zdravo Mladi Festival, and this is the best news so far this year.</s></p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>The Babe Rainbow &#8211; Double Rainbow&nbsp;</strong>(July2018)</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Magician\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x9hmJoSLeZo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same manner as on their debut album, on their sophomore effort The Babe Rainbow once again reference the sound of the late ’60s and early ’70s. Yet, this time it is done with a more laid-back groove, lacking the funky and disco elements that they had on some tracks on their previous record. Double Rainbow&nbsp;is a record that brings the summer breeze feel, waves, surfers and sunny beaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Triptides &#8211; Visitors</strong>&nbsp;(April 2018)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Triptides&nbsp;are a psychedelic rock band from Los Angeles, and Visitors is their sixth record so far. The first track “All my life” immediately sets a warm, positive and melodic beginning of the album. A similar summer ambient that evokes the era of the love revolution lurks from each corner of the album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the new psychedelic music, the summer of 2018 got its colors and sound of a summer from the late 1960s. The last couple of years I am making up for all the music that I have missed growing up in the era of grunge in which psychedelic rock was considered a kind of <em>passe</em>. Luckily, psychedelic rock is having a comeback riding on a new wave of the bands that make music that sounds as if it was recorded late in the 1960s, long forgotten on a shelf and rediscovered once again. It is a dose of a old-new psychedelic sound which is much needed in this digital era of crunched decibels and no sense of subtlety in music production.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As far as I could remember, in the current year we are experiencing one of the most untypical summers. Cloudy days and temperatures below 40 degrees Celsius. I like this kind of weather since I am not a huge fan of the continental summers and extremely high temperatures (but then again, who is?).

A few years back it was only a shy notion, but now it could definitely be said that Australia along with New Zealand have the most interesting and most productive alternative scenes, especially in terms of psychedelic rock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Australia has always had a vibrant rock and roll scene. As we researched their underground scene, we realized that this continent has given us a plethora of cult bands on a global level. Still, the Australian cultural influence was not as able to penetrate the boundaries when compared to the ginormous American or British influence. Thus, in our heads, Australia remained a partial <em>terra incongnita.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we list some of our favorite bands and artists originating from Australia and New Zealand.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"512\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sidney-Olivia-Dorazi.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise_in_Sidney\" class=\"wp-image-72\" srcset=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:512/h:640/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sidney-Olivia-Dorazi.jpg 512w, https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:240/h:300/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sidney-Olivia-Dorazi.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /><figcaption>Photo: Sunrise in Sidney, by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/oliviadoraziart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Olivia Dorazi</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard&nbsp;represent one of the most productive bands of the Australian scene that emerged at the start of the 2010s.&nbsp;Since they held their promise to release five albums in 2017 (with Gumboot soup they managed to fulfill that promise just in time on the 30<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of December, 2017), the band has toured Europe and America and almost all of their dates were sold out.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"King Gizzard &amp; The Lizard Wizard - The Fourth Colour - (Live)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9G5uLFxIj8w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Babe Rainbow</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The hippies are alive and live in Australia. It is unimaginable how The Babe Rainbow manage to sound and look as if they were literally brought to the present by a time machine. With the marry colors, sounds and positive vibrations there carry the groove and charm of the late 1960s. Their positive music shines with sunny light from the warm meadows of the south hemisphere. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Babe Rainbow - Peace Blossom Boogy (Official Video)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p875E_kk50o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Courtney Barnett</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This modest Australian managed to get the world’s attention and to build a sold fan base, especially in the United States. After her collaboration with Kurt Vile, an interesting combination of two artists that resulted in their record Lotta Sea Lice, Courtney Barnett&nbsp;announced her second album Tell Me How You Really Feel&nbsp;scheduled for release in May. Three singles from the album have already been released.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Courtney Barnett - Need A Little Time\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TISIPNpRuoY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Fazerdaze</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, those wonderful 90s! The era of flannel plaid shirts, Dr. Martens, Levis and alternative music as mainstream culture. The current generations often cite the music and fashion deriving from this era. Fazedaze is a nice girl from New Zealand whose dreampop/shoegase music is incredibly reminiscent of the 90’s and turns on the nostalgia switch right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Little Uneasy - Fazerdaze\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/szvFmW_oxeY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pond</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Band that is inescapably related to Tame Impala. The members of both bands frequently interchange, while the former is fronted by Nick Allbrook. On their former records the music resembles psychedelic rock, but on their latest record (it could be argued in a disappointing manner) they experiment with synth pop in a similar manner as Tame Impala did on Currents. The video for the track Fire in the Water was directed by New Zealand director Sam Kristofski, who also made videos for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://youtu.be/My4j3vgFxbE\" target=\"_blank\">Fazerdaze</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/OumAw7yfk7U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Babe Rainbow</a>. The videos feature a specific vintage ascetic and a weird obsession with hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Pond - Fire In The Water (Official Video)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BycrWr9z_X0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Chats</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Very funny and truly <em>sipmpatico </em>young surf-punks<em>. </em>Even the legendary Australian mullets found on the singer’s hairdo are completely legitimate. The simplistic punk refrain of Smoko immediately catches your ear and no wonder the song is a viral hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"THE CHATS - SMOKO  (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j58V2vC9EPc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Cosmic Psychos</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Old punks formed in 1977 still bringing fresh and exiting music and worthy of mention on this list. Cosmic Psychos&nbsp;are not only relevant in Australia, but also very influential for the Seattle scene of the 1990s. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands for the stylistic formation of grunge. Eddie Vedder himself recognized Cosmic Psychos&nbsp;as an early influence on him and his band.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Cosmic Psychos - Fuckwit City\" width=\"740\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q954LxEzyY8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More bands are worth the mention. For instance, The Murlocs, a band led by Kenny-Smith of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, the psychedelic ORB, as well as Stonefield&nbsp;&#8211; four Johnny Mitchel lookalikes sisters who originate from a town called Macedon Ranges.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>There is a new wave of freshness coming from the land down under.
