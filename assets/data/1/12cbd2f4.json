{"data":{"post":{"title":"A brief guide through Vienna’s record stores","date":"2020-07-05T12:27:17","content":"\n<p>As a city known for its baroque and neoclassical architecture,&nbsp;it is pretty clear that Vienna has&nbsp;a classical appeal. Having its rich classical music background in mind, it could&nbsp;reasonably be expected that its main cultural offer&nbsp;would be geared towards the more or less aristocratic tastes.&nbsp;In this sense, we would think that the city has little to give us in terms of alternative culture and independent music. Yet, even though it might lack the contemporary hipness of other European capitals, this would surely be an understatement.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-opt-src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:682/h:1024/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Teutchler-1.jpg\"  width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20682%201024%22%20width%3D%22682%22%20height%3D%221024%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-231\"/><noscript><img width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:682/h:1024/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Teutchler-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-231\"/></noscript><figcaption>Teuchtler Record Shop</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Before visiting the city, the only record store that I was aware of was <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/teuchtler.recordshopvienna\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Teuchtler Schallplattenhandlung u. Antiquariat</a>, an old Viennese institution featured in the film Before sunrise. What I was not aware of, was that the city indeed has a decent number of jams that I would gladly revisit when hopefully coming to town once again. In this article, I present some of the most exciting Viennese record shops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick tip:&nbsp;getting on the tram number 49 on Karl Renner station on the Ring will take you to Westbahnstrasse. Here you’ll find three record shops and you&#8217;ll be able to easily reach a number of others nearby.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Substance</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Westbahnstrasse 16</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I had the time to visit only one record store in Vienna, <a href=\"https://substance-store.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Substance</a> would be it. The store has a diverse catalog along with a well-maintained website. There you’ll&nbsp;find more recent releases of mostly independent labels. Definitely a favorite record store in Vienna.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img data-opt-src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Substance.jpg\"  width=\"960\" height=\"639\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20viewBox%3D%220%200%20100%%20100%%22%20width%3D%22100%%22%20height%3D%22100%%22%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-221\"/><noscript><img width=\"960\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://ml6h13xawk1g.i.optimole.com/Al67Mnc.28qX~ddaf/w:auto/h:auto/q:82/https://missalbini.mk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Substance.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-221\"/></noscript><figcaption>Photo credit: Substance Facebook page</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Schallter</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Westbahnstraße 13</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When leaving Substance, turn to the right and cross Westbahstrasse.

It’s a record store that has a more eclectic offer when compared to Substance. Besides records, the store offers a wide array of HI-FI equipment.
